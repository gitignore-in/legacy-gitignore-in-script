# legacy-gitignore-in-script

## Notice

This script is a legacy script that generates a file named `gitignore.in`.
Currently, a new method is being implemented, so it is not recommended to start using this script.

## Problem

The method of generating `.gitignore` from a template is already widespread.
For example, there are the following methods.

- gibo
- gitignore.io
- .gitignore generated when creating a repository on GitHub

However, the `.gitignore` file generated by these methods is not updated over time.
The result of `gibo dump Python` executed in 2018 and the result of `gibo dump Python` executed in 2023 will be different.
In order for the project to use the latest `.gitignore`, you need to update `.gitignore` regularly.
However, this is a troublesome task that can cause mistakes.

## Solution

`gitignore.in` is a script to solve it.
    
1. When you first run this script in a Git repository, it generates a shell script `.gitignore.in` that lists `gibo dump` and `gi` commands.
2. When you run this shell script, `.gitignore` is generated.
3. Files that you want to ignore for that repository can be appended with `echo "..."`.
4. If the `.gitignore.in` file already exists, execute the written script to update the `.gitignore` file.
